# Basics of Git

## Branches

1 - Creating a new branch: `git branch <name_of_branch>`
2 - Checkout to the newly created branch: `git checkout <name_of_branch>`
3 - Create and switch to the new branch: `git checkout -b <name_of_branch> e.g. <name_of_the_user/new_feature>`

- Removing the branch: `git branch -d <name_of_branch>`
